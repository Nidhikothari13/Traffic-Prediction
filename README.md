Traffic Prediction

This repository contains Python code for predicting traffic volume using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is traffic volume data collected over time. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts traffic volume based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and historical traffic data.
